## üìñ Project Overview & Purpose

As a requirement for the completion of my Bachelor's Degree, this project aims to design and implement a modern, all-in-one digital solution to enhance the student and faculty experience at the NUM IT Faculty.

The primary goal is to centralize information and services, creating a single, reliable hub for academic details, student schedules, university resources, and instant support through an intelligent AI assistant. This platform addresses the need for a more integrated and accessible digital environment for both prospective and current students.
